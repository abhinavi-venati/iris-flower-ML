# iris-flower-ML
Utilizing the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, this code classifies Iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes data preprocessing, cross-validation for training and evaluation, and computation of accuracy and confusion matrix. The trained model is saved, and a user interface enables interactive species prediction
